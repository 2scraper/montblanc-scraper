montblanc-scraper — pyppeteer edition (secondary engine)
========================================================

The same scrape as playwright_scraper.py, driven through pyppeteer. It must
agree with its twins on exit codes, run status, and whether a run crashes or
spends money — the decisions that determine all three live in page_flow.py
and output_writer.finish_run(), so this file is browser plumbing and nothing
else.

    --mode category   (default)  /{locale}/{category-path}?start=N&sz=24
    --mode search                /{locale}/search?q=…&start=N&sz=24
    --mode product               one /{locale}/{slug}-MB{id}.html page,
                                 emitted as one row PER VARIANT

See playwright_scraper.py's header for what is different about this site —
the ungated datacenter access, the edge refusal that is a connection reset
rather than a page, the `ProductGroup` on detail pages, and the merchandised
default ordering this repo deliberately overrides.

Two things to know before choosing this engine:

  * **pyppeteer is effectively unmaintained** and its own README points at
    Playwright. It is here for parity, and for anyone who already has it.
  * **No --concurrency.** The Playwright engine is the one that fetches pages
    in parallel; the flag is accepted here and reported as ignored rather
    than silently doing nothing.

Unlike the Selenium engine, this one CAN authenticate a remote CDP endpoint
(`browserWSEndpoint` takes a full `ws://user:pass@host:port`) and a proxy
(`page.authenticate`).

Usage
-----
    python puppeteer_scraper.py \\
        --url "https://www.montblanc.com/en-us/writing-instruments" --pages 3

Requires: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-puppeteer.txt
          (pyppeteer downloads its own Chromium on first run)

    needs wrapping. What differs is that a product page has no listing-level
    arithmetic to report, hence the None.

    The two entry points are separate on purpose and it is not tidiness.
    A product page publishes `ProductGroup` and no `ItemList`, so calling
    the listing parser on one finds no structured data and then falls
    through to its tile path — which on a real product page returns the
    "you may also like" carousel as eighteen products, measured, in
    silence. `parse_products` refuses a detail page for that reason and
    `smoke_test.py` pins both directions (§20).

    `page_num` is threaded through rather than defaulted, because `position`
    restarts at 1 on every page: without the page number beside it, a row
    from page 2 claims the same position as one from page 1 and the two are
